# Other projects using prolog to create (medical) expert systems:

* [Medical Diagnosis system using Prolog created by Shiddika Jahan Bushra](https://github.com/sjbushra/Medical-Diagnosis-system-using-Prolog/) This is a clean way to create an expert system. Please be aware that the license of the code is unclear so it is better not to reuse that code.
* [NephroDoctor created by Nicola Dileo and Tommaso Viterbo](https://github.com/nicoladileo/NephroDoctor) Shows how to make diagnostic using  probability, modify the answers and save the symptoms to a file
* [Medical Expert System for COVID-19 from Rojay White and others](https://github.com/R-White-0/Medical-Expert-System) It uses 3 or more symptoms
  to diagnostic COVID-19. It shows how to use windows, messages boxes and checkboxes to ask for user imput with Prolog. Notice: Works locally but not on the online version of SWI Prolog.
