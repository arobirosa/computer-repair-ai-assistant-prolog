# Evaluation of Prolog implementations and development environments

The following ones were evaluated for use in this project:

* [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) **Choosen**. It can link Prolog predicates to an SQL database, Java and Python. It can work on both Windows and Linux-based systems. It can be used to create Web Applications
* [Prolog Development Tool - PDT](https://sewiki.iai.uni-bonn.de/research/pdt/docs/start) **Choosen** It has a console to execute any predicate while working on a prolog script. This is better than the support provided by Intellij IDEA with the Logtalk plugin.

### Discarded

* [ErgoAI](https://github.com/ErgoAI) Documentation is poor. Discarded. It can link Prolog predicates to an SQL database, Java and Python
* [Visual Prolog](https://www.visual-prolog.com/) Discarded. It only works on Windows and its syntax is propietary.
* [XSB: a deductive database](https://xsb.sourceforge.net/) It is used by ErgoAI internally.
* [GNU Prolog](https://www.gprolog.org/) It can't use databases to get predicates
* [ECLiPSe is an open-source software system for the cost-effective development and deployment of constraint programming applications, e.g. in the areas of planning, scheduling, resource allocation, timetabling, transport etc.](http://www.eclipseclp.org/) Better for constraint based problems
* [Jprolog](https://github.com/jiprolog/jiprolog/releases) The website is outdated and the last change was on 2015.
